# Image-Analysis-of-thin-section-of-rocks
Application name: ImRock

Requirements:

¬	MATLAB software
¬	Thin section images of rocks for testing

Instructions:

¬	Start by executing the New.m MATLAB script.
¬	A GUI will be opened where you have to first select the path to thin section images through the file explorer and then select the parameters for the structuring element.
¬	Next step is to press the compute button.
¬	The computation will take time depending in the number of samples provided by you.
¬	After computation is over 3 graphs will be printed with the parameters shown on the respective axes.
¬	The parameter values will be shown in the respective text boxes.
¬	Pressing the input samples button on the GUI will open the folder where input samples were stored.
¬	To specify the path for the resultant images, edit the line 544 in New.m script.
¬	After making the above change you will able to see the resultant images by clicking the show output images button
